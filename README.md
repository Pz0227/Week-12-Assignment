# Week 12 Assignment 
This repo contains my Week 12 exercise. For this assignment, I worked with a dataset that is directly connected to my course project on movie analysis and explored it using both VS Code and Jupyter Notebook. I first completed a full data workflow in VS Code by fetching the IMDB Top 100 movies from the RapidAPI endpoint in Python, converting the API response into a pandas DataFrame, and exporting it as a CSV. I then applied spaCy NLP to extract the most frequent plot keywords from each movie description, analyzed the genre distribution to identify dominant storytelling patterns, generated a bar chart visualizing genre frequency, and printed a clear summary of thematic insights in the terminal—all while securely storing my API key in a `.env` file to protect sensitive information when publishing the project on GitHub.
