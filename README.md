# Week 12 Assignment 
This repo contains my Week 12 exercise. For this assignment, I worked with a dataset that is directly connected to my course project of movie analysis, and I completed a full data workflow by fetching the IMDB Top 100 movies from the RapidAPI endpoint in Python, converting the API response into a pandas DataFrame, and exporting it as a CSV. I then applied spaCy NLP to extract the most frequent plot keywords from each movie description, analyzed the genre distribution to identify dominant storytelling patterns, generated a bar chart visualizing genre frequency, and printed a clear summary of thematic insights in the terminal—all while securely storing my API key in a `.env` file to protect sensitive information when publishing the project to GitHub.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the IMDB Top 100 movies using Python, integrating API data retrieval, NLP text processing, and data visualization. The script securely fetches the dataset from the RapidAPI endpoint, converts it into a structured DataFrame, extracts dominant plot keywords using spaCy, examines genre frequency trends across the Top 100 list, and visualizes the results through a bar chart. The workflow runs entirely in VS Code and maintains security best practices by storing the API key in a `.env` file to prevent exposure when sharing the repository on GitHub.
